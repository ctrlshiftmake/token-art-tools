### Version 1.0 Features

The following features are planned for the initial release of the application. If you have any suggestions - or discover bugs - please create a GitHub issue. I'm keen to hear from artists on other platforms as well, so that it can support many different formats of token / hash variables.

- [ ] README preview and instructions
- [ ] HashPair Controls
- [x] ArtBlocks.io Token Format
- [ ] Screenshot Current Artwork
- [ ] Generate `n` Random Screenshots
- [ ] Lock HashPair `value` to avoid random
